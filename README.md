# Digital Clock

This is a basic digital clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It shows the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, and updates every second.

## Features

- Real-time clock using JavaScript
- Simple UI with a green digital-style font
- Responsive design centered on the screen

## Files

- `index.html` – main HTML structure
- `style.css` – styling for the clock (black background and green font)
- `app.js` – JavaScript code that updates the clock every second

## How to Run

Just open the `index.html` file in your browser. The clock will start automatically.

## What I Learned

- How to use `setInterval()` to update time
- Working with the DOM in JavaScript
- Basic CSS layout and font styling
